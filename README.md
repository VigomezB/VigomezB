# About me 

Hi 👋 welcome to my Github profile!  

I am Víctor, an economist with a focus on economic history, finance, and economic developtment.

In 2021, I earned my Ph.D. from the Carlos III University of Madrid —a journey that led to the María Teresa Pérez Picazo Award in 2024 for the Best Doctoral Thesis in Economic History in Spain and Latin America.

Since then, my career has taken me through various roles in research and academia. I have worked on an ERC project as a researcher at the Carlos III-Juan March Institute, held a postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Finance at Tilburg University, and taught as an Assistant Professor at the University of Valencia and Lecturer at CUNEF . 

Currently, I  serve as a Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics at University of Alcalá and an Associate Affiliate at Figuerola Institute and WEIPO research group.

Rather than taking more of your time here, I invite you to visit my personal website (**https://www.victorgomezblanco.com/**) where you can find my CV, publications, and further details about my research.
